## Requisite
The harmonic analysis of the eNATL60 outputs needs :

  - the `TIDAL_TOOLS` :  https://github.com/molines/TIDAL_TOOLS
  - the python script made by Laurent : `tidal_cplx_to_amp.py`

##Steps
  - the harmonic analysis is performed :  https://github.com/molines/TIDAL_TOOLS
  - the `x_elev`, `y_elev` outputs are transformed into amplitude and phase
  - the plots are produced :
