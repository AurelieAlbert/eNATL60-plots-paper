Currently working with 0 workers

ORTE has lost communication with its daemon located on node:

  hostname:  n3074

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
